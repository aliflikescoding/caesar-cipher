# caesar-cipher with ruby
a simple caesar-cipher in ruby
## Logic
The logic is based on the ASCII alphabet numbers number positions and if the alphabet
ends A.K.A at 'Z or z' just like a nomral caesar cipher it starts again from the 
begining and this caesar cipher only affects alphabets so symobls like !@#%$ and others would not be affected
